# Python 1D Euler Solver for Sod Shock Tube

## Overview

This is a simple Python project implementing a Finite Volume Method (FVM) solver for the 1D Euler equations. The primary test case is the standard Sod Shock Tube problem.

This code has been developed for learning purposes to explore fundamental concepts in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

## Core Features

* 1D Euler Equations for compressible, inviscid flow.


## Running the Code

*(More detailed instructions on parameters and plotting can be added later.)*

## Reference Problem

The main validation case is Sod's Shock Tube problem, as described by:
Sod, Gary A. “A Survey of Several Finite Difference Methods for Systems of Nonlinear Hyperbolic Conservation Laws.” *Journal of Computational Physics* 27, no. 1 (April 1, 1978): 1–31.

## Note

This is primarily a learning project and not intended as a production-grade CFD tool.
